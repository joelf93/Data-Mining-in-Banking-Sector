# Data Mining in Banking Sector: Case of the Portuguese bank

The increasingly vast number of marketing campaigns of banking institutions over the time has reduced its effect on the public. Furthermore, economical pressure and competition has led with the advancement of the data science and machine learning to the fact that most of banks are adapting to a data-drive decision using direct marketing to generate an increasing interest. Despite of numerous studies that have provided important insights into the direct marketing, the understanding of this topic of growing interest and importance still remains deficient. Therefore, in this project we are going to use the EDA processing and data mining method to build a predictive model for a Portuguese bank to provide the necessary suggestion for marketing campaign team in order to target a specific category of customer which is more susceptible to subscribe to the new product as well the term deposit.
